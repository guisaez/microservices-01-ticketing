## Creating a Shared Library

The idea is to share common code across multiple services such as middlewares.

We are going to use NPM by creating public library.

All contents of this library are located in the common directory.

## Steps:
1. Create a git-repo and npm module in directory
```shell
git init
```
```shell
npm init -y
```
2. Install some packages in module
    * tsc
    * del-cli
    * typescript

3. To be continued ...
